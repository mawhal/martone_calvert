This data package contains all data associated with seaweed surveys initiated by Sandra C. Lindstrom and Patrick T. Martone on Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada. These studies were designed to track intertidal biodiversity over time and across environmental gradients. All work was conducted within the Hakai Lúxvbálís Conservancy

## Overview of Survey Design:
- Annual surveys of sessile organisms (algae + invertebrates) using 0.5 x 0.5 meter quadrats
- Three sites on Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada (Fourth site added in 2015)
- Three transects at each site running parallel to shore in low, middle, and high intertidal zones
- Ten quadrats per transect randomly selected each year
- ✨ Over 100 species of seaweed have been  observed in this survey!

## Features

- Data on percent cover of sessile organisms
- Supplementary data on mobile invertebrates (not consistently collected)
- Metadata about sites and surveys, including 
    - geolocations
    - maps
    - sample dates
    - people involved in data collection
- Database protocols
- R scripts to clean and merge raw data
- Photographs of quadrats
- Environmental data collected in situ, including and from other locations
    - in situ data include 
        -  quadrat elevation from laser level 
        -  site elevation from photogrammetry
        -  rock temperature data 
- Environmental data collected from other locations including
    - Calvert Island Lookout
